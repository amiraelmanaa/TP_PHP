## 📌 Project Overview   and 🌐 Database Connection Details 📢
This project is an implementation of what we have studied in PHP, focusing on the **Repository Pattern** for database interactions using  **PHP PDO**. We applied **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to create a reusable database management system.  
It is also important to not that in  **Exercise 4: the student managment application**, we hosted our database on a **free MySQL hosting service** (mysqlfreedatabase) to allow external access and testing and for teamwork collaboration on the database management.
 If you want to access it, use the following credentials:  
```php
$host = "sql7.freesqldatabase.com";
$dbname = "sql7771121";
$username = "sql7771121";
$password = "7MpCGHJkUT";
$port = "3306";
```
ℹ️You can connect to the database using **PHPMyAdmin** or any MySQL client.
